Do you find the code to be simpler when using AngularJS? If so, how? If not, why?
- I found the code to be simpler with angularJS, because it divides the application into 
	View and Controller. Scope can be considered the Model, through which data binding 
	occurs. It made it simpler for me to understand the whole application since I am used 
	to working with MVC.

Would a beginner to front-end development find the code to be simpler? Why or why not?
- If they are familiar with MVC, I believe they will find the code to be simpler. Because
	AngularJS loosely follows the MVC idea, it makes it easier to understand the code and 
	the application. HTML is the View, JavaScript is the Controller, and you can think of 
	the Scope as the Model.

How might the structure provided by AngularJS simplify building larger web applications?
- The structure provided by AngularJS simplifies building larger web applications since
	the application can be built as a Single Page Application(SPA) with multiple views. 
	Having the application as a SPA simplifies building the application and it keeps all 
	the parts loosely coupled.
